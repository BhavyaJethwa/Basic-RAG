# LangChain Document and Retrieval Chains

## Description

LangChain is a robust framework designed to facilitate the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It streamlines each phase of the LLM application lifecycle, providing tools for development, production, and deployment. This project includes retrieval chains and document loaders to help developers create intelligent systems that can understand and respond to natural language queries.

### Key Features
- Seamless integration with popular LLMs like OpenAI.
- Document loaders for various formats including HTML, Markdown, and PDFs.
- Retrieval systems to source and organize documents effectively.
- A community of resources for support and tutorials.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python 3 installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-docs-retrieval.git
   cd langchain-docs-retrieval
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI and Langchain API keys:    
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langchain_api_key
   ```

## Usage

To utilize the retrieval systems within this project, you can initiate by importing the models and invoking the necessary functions.

### Example
```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

# Load documents from a specified web path
loader = WebBaseLoader(web_paths=("https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction",))
docs = loader.load()
```

### Document Retrieval
```python
from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS

# Create a vector store from the loaded documents and initialize retrieval
faiss_vec_db = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
faiss_retriever = faiss_vec_db.as_retriever()
retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(faiss_retriever, document_chain)

# Perform a query
response = retrieval_chain.invoke({"input": "What is LangChain?"})
print(response['answer'])
```

## Configuration

You can manage configurations through environment variables or directly in the `.env` file. Here are some additional parameters you can configure:

- `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true`
- `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com`
- `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your_project_name`

## API Reference

This project provides several APIs for document handling and retrieval operations. Key endpoints include:
- **Document Loaders**: Load documents from various formats (e.g., WebBaseLoader, CSVLoader).
- **Retrieval Chains**: Create retrieval systems to facilitate information sourcing.
